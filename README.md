### My journey 👨‍🦯
- early AI SaaS product development in AI startup (Company.AI)
- Developed and launched multiple MMORPG products for global targets over the past 6 years
- Web technology research and development: Results of improving game engine performance in tick units
- ProtoPie (No code - Prototyping Tool) enterprise service development: No-code ecosystem experience design

### My strengths 🤔
- **I am interested in user-centred product development and improvement.** During the development of the ProtoPie product, all team members, including myself, were involved in user-centred product development, actively exploring improvements and presenting edge cases to create a natural flow and minimise cognitive burden on users.
- **I have an ongoing interest in the operation and maintenance of infrastructure and its incremental improvement.** Having worked as a CTO for 6 years in a startup company, where I was solely responsible for building and operating the infrastructure, I have been thinking about what is the right structure for the company and actively applying new technologies. Although I could not always use the latest technology for each project, I have the analytical ability to choose, learn, and apply what is the most appropriate technology at the current scale.
- **I have a strong eye for integrating knowledge across the board. Since I was the lead for all non-Ops/Planning tech issues within the company, I had to understand everything from networking configurations to infrastructure, DBMS, backend, and frontend. This helped me identify which unit was the problem and devise countermeasures when issues arose. I also have experience optimising and tuning each unit to improve performance.
- **I have experience launching/running multiple projects.** I have served as a development leader for game and platform projects, organised basic system construction/deployment, planned and developed tools and administrators for service operation, and configured appropriate scale-out infrastructure for overseas service expansion.
- **Above all, my strengths lie in communication and project drive.** As a team leader, I learned how to communicate with team members with different personalities to ensure smooth work progress. Also, as a co-founder, I have always put the success of the project first, so I understand the direction of the project and think of the best means to reach the goal.
